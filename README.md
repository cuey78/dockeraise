# Dockeraise
Raise a full Docker installation in your server with ease!

Simple bash script to automate the installation of Docker (and Docker compose) on servers running Debian. 
It also lets you create a Docker user.

> Should work on both Debian 11 and 12. Only tested on fresh Debian 12 installations. Reviewing the code is recommended.

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cuey78/dockeraise/main/dockeraise.sh | sudo bash
